                        I’m Loris Buchelet. I was born in 1994 and raised in the North of France where I spent my childhood and teenage years in the countryside. I have always been very involved in my studies, and I’ve grown interested in IT since I was young. That’s, by the way, at the age of 12 that I first discovered front-end languages like HTML and CSS through free online lessons and tutorials.<br>

	My dad worked as a primary school teacher and most likely influenced me into becoming a teacher. Since I literally fell in love with English language, I quickly paved my own path to achieve my dream of becoming an English teacher. I never gave up on computer studies, yet, as it kept finding a position in my daily life. I passed my baccalaureate (or A-level) in 2012 with flying colours and moved to Lille where I started my English degree at university. Three years later, I wanted to be more confident and fluent in English, and applied for the assistantship programme. I managed to get a position as a French assistant in a school in Newbury, not so far from Oxford, in England. This enriching experience allowed me to become more independent and taught me so much more than English in the end.<br>

	Moving back to France in June 2016, I was 100% sure about becoming an English teacher, so I went back to uni to finish my studies. I passed the competitive exam (CAPES) and my Master’s degree and became a teacher, as planned.<br>

	I was of course proud of fulfilling my dream and took my new position very seriously and with pleasure. Teaching is indeed a thrilling job. I managed to use my IT knowledges to make my lessons more cheerful and enjoyable to the pupils. I even took part in e-twinning projects and went abroad with Erasmus+. Unfortunately, I slowly became aware that, despite its advantages, being a teacher had its dark sides and failed to make sense out of my work. After seven years as an English teacher, I realised it was time I left this position and started something new. I wanted to achieve a new dream: becoming a web developer. <br>

	As such, I watched and read tutorials and started making small personal projects on my own, thanks to Openclassrooms. After a tough year as a teacher in 2023, I was determined to make it my last year as a teacher. I immediately looked for an online training that would allow me to keep my job as a teacher for the rest of the school year while working from home on weekends or whenever I had free time. I started my training on Studi with one final goal set to September 2024 : passing my Developer Graduate.<br>
 
	2023-2024 has been hard-work since I had to switch from one rôle to another. Paradoxically enough this has been one of the best year I had ever had as a teacher, probably due to the fact I knew it was the last one! I’ve always been extremely organised, but those last months probably taught me how to become even more organised.<br>

	By the end of May 2024, the National Board of Education agreed to let me leave my position as a teacher. That’s how I signed a mutually agreed termination of contract set to end at the end of August. <br>

	L’année scolaire 2023-2024 a ainsi été riche en travail puisqu’il m’a fallu jongler entre ma casquette de professeur (un rôle que j’ai tenu jusqu’au bout en restant professionnel et en gardant à coeur la réussite de mes élèves) et celle d’étudiant, le soir et le week-end. Si je suis, de base, une personne organisée, j’ai dû l’être encore plus pendant ces mois de formation.<br>

	Today, I’m working and hoping to add this Graduate as a new line on my resume. The exam is planned at the end of September. I’m currently looking for a block release training to set a first food in a company while sharpening my skills in Web dev.
